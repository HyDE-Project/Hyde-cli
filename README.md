# Read Me

Hyprdots-ctl is a command-line interface for [Hyprdots ricing](https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots). This repository contains scripts that are currently in the WIP phase, but could potentially be useful. This CLI aims to add patches for Hyprdots and update the script to address common configuration issues and requests. Please be aware that using these scripts may alter your configurations.

Hyprdots is stable, but this CLI is designed to be an active helper to some issues or some feature requests for Hyprdots. It is important to note that these scripts may alter or mess up your configurations. Please use them at your discretion.

### Warning

These scripts may alter or mess up your configurations. Please use them at your discretion.
